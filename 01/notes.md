Each symbol represents a white or a black cell. You can quickly see the 3x
fiducial markers from a QR code and adjust which are white/black based on that.
Might've been my transcription, but the rows between the top and bottom
fiducials had to be flipflopped to match the QR code spec. Key in on the
alternating dots between the left fiducials as well as the fact that the
fiducials have a white border.

See spreadsheet for the tedious crap.
